For this reason, we started Minlopro Partners where we aim to bridge this gap for those customers we've seen get left behind. Our resources are placed in strategic pods and work together as a team on all projects, from the beginning of the sales cycle to Managed Services after project go-live.\n\nWe are excited and honored to be a part of our client's business transformations and find it extremely rewarding to bring efficiency and scalability to companies that are working to make the world a better place for all its inhabitants.",

L’approccio Agile si presta molto bene a gestire le fasi di rilascio incrementale di prodotti oppure in situazioni in cui non possono essere applicate tecniche di pianificazione e stima accurate perché non tutte le informazioni sono disponibili in fase di avvio. La metodologia Agile si è ormai affermata nella maggioranza dei gruppi di lavoro, grazie alla sua prospettiva moderna e altamente flessibile. Contrapposta ai metodi tradizionali (come quello “a cascata”), non impone un’analisi immutabile fin dall’inizio, ma richiede che il team sia sempre aperto ai cambiamenti.",

We want our solutions to serve people in their work. So we design people-centered solutions, test them to make sure the database does what is needed for them, then build.\n\nThis way we ensure the database is set up to support your unique processes and procedures. Also, by engaging with people in the design process, we support their capacity to embrace the changes to the way they work.\n\nBut best of all, through our people-centered approach, your investment in Salesforce leads to data-informed decisions.\n\nAfter all, you own this data. Why have it, if it doesn’t help you chart your nonprofit's future?\n\nLet your data work for you.\n\nChoose Ascendably to guide the way through Clarity. Competence. Confidence.",

By automating our repeatable processes, we had an edge over our competitors.\n\nAfter learning the Solar Industry inside and out, we decided to start Intigra to help other solar companies achieve the same rocket ship growth that we did.

This expertise extends beyond technical know-how into wider issues ISVs encounter when launching their app and supporting their customers.\n\nAdditionally, Appiphony has built a PDO design practice to address the demand ISVs face for dramatically improved user experiences. Modern app stores have raised the bar of competition, and Appiphony's design methodology delivers great interfaces as well as great code.",

Now that companies can “rent” the commodity layer of technology and focus instead on the capabilities that differentiate them, they can move faster and focus on customers.\n\nWhile the benefits of on-demand technology and on-demand work are well\ndocumented, those looking to take advantage of this model will face some\nchallenges. Companies are now armed with powerful cloud platforms, but they often have trouble finding, hiring, and retaining the talent they need to make these\nplatforms flourish in their business.\n\nWe started 10K because we saw a role for a new kind of consultancy. A firm that could help companies of all sizes – not just the big ones with lots of money – find the talent they need, when they need it. A firm that could do this while also supporting independent contractors who want to work with great clients while maintaining their freedom and flexibility. Our goal is to give people the freedom to excel at the work they love.",
