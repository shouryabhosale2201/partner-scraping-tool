So we do everything we can to match you up with the right technology and keep it running smoothly day in and day out. We'll keep an eye out for products and processes that could save you precious time and money. And, we'll help you avoid the ones that won't.\nWe're big enough to offer you premium quality and selection. And we're small enough to give you personalized service grounded in Midwestern values. As your technology partner, we offer you the perfect mix of both worlds.\nWhere it all started.\nBack in 1973, Gary Marsden and Dave Marquardt (whose last names inspired the \"Mar\" in Marco) started as a small typewriter shop in St. Cloud, Minnesota.
