MarginEdge was selected as Intuit's first restaurant industry unified solution provider and empowers accountants to scale their restaurant client base without any manual data entry or additional labor. Line-item details of invoices are processed and sent to Quickbooks in as little as 24 hours and stored in the cloud for easy access. Other key features include free bill pay, in-platform ordering, automatic pricing updates, food usage reporting, menu analysis and price alerts. \n<b>What We Do</b> MarginEdge takes restaurant back-office paperwork down to 2-3 minutes per day and lets operators make decisions in real time instead of after the period ends. Manual entry is eliminated as invoices are sent by taking a picture on the app, uploading, emailing or electronically from the vendor. MarginEdge processes, categorizes and adjusts for hand-written corrections through a powerful combination of machine learning and human review. Data syncs between the POS, invoice submissions and Quickbooks to provide daily P&amp;L and automated custom reports. \n<b>Who We Serve</b> MarginEdge exclusively serves the restaurant vertical. CFOs, restaurant owners, operators and accountants with restaurant clients can all benefit from integrating QuickBooks with MarginEdge.",
