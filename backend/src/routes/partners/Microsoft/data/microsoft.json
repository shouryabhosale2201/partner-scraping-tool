Procure Microsoft® Azure® public cloud subscriptions through Hewlett Packard Enterprise, or host Azure consistent services in the security of your own data center with the HPE ProLiant for Microsoft Azure Stack solution. Regardless of the right mix public or private cloud you choose, HPE Operational Services can help optimize your Microsoft Azure hybrid environment.\n\nSimplify and control adoption of the cloud in your enterprise\nModern cloud computing technology can simplify IT tremendously and deliver significant business benefits, but the complexity of yet another vendor, technology, language, and procedure, can be daunting. Similarly. Some organizations have specific security, compliance, performance, and cost requirements that limit their use of the public cloud. A hybrid strategy is the way to go, but only if it’s simple and secure. \n\nHPE and Microsoft are working closely to empower customers through the Microsoft Azure hybrid cloud. We’re enabling enterprises to operate workloads that belong in the cloud and leverage PaaS for cloud native app development. At the same time, we’re helping you gain Azure service consistency along with on-premises security and control with the HPE ProLiant for Microsoft Azure Stack platform. Leveraging HPE Pointnext expertise, services, and global support, we can help you to find the right mix of public and private cloud, strategically deploy cloud services, simplify hybrid IT operations, and achieve best use of your Microsoft Azure hybrid cloud solution. \n\nOperational Services for Microsoft Azure from HPE Pointnext can help you achieve these benefits—and enhance your overall experience with the technology. \n\nLearn more at: hpe.com/services/datacentercare\n\nPlease email LicensingSolutions@hpe.com for queries regarding CSP pricing and quoting",

Regardless of the right mix public or private cloud you choose, HPE Operational Services can help optimize your Microsoft Azure hybrid environment.\n\nSimplify and control adoption of the cloud in your enterprise\nModern cloud computing technology can simplify IT tremendously and deliver significant business benefits, but the complexity of yet another vendor, technology, language, and procedure, can be daunting.

Either by starting early in the digitization phase or by getting involved later on in the growth stage, we become an integral part of our clients’ business.\n \nAs end to end software development providers, we cover various industries while maintaining a consistent approach to deliver top notch solutions. We work successfully with our clients either by incubating teams and covering everything from top to bottom or by augmenting their own team and acting as an extension of their business, helping them scale with a bit more firepower. This brought us long term relationships with clients and companies from all over the world, mainly from the United States and Europe.\n \nNo matter the business model, our policy is to build products and support businesses, not just provide lines of code. That means that besides our army of software developers we also employ business analysts, product managers, UX designers, manual and automation QA testers, offering a full range of services. In the end, we’re more than providers or developers. We’re your partner in building the right solution for your business.",

Today, Nexus is proud to be a prominent force in the Philippine IT industry, having carved a niche as the systems integrator and corporate IT reseller of choice of some of the Philippines' top corporations. It has successfully forged long-term client partnerships anchored by a keen understanding that technology plays a pivotal role in the delivery and the achievement of an organization's business goals.\n \nNexus is ably steered by the reputable industry experience and histories of its founders, Juan Chua, Alfonso Olondriz, and Mario Arroyo. The Nexus leadership makes it a fundamental practice to hire the best people in the industry and takes under its wings new blood with potential. As a result, the 200-strong company maintains a vibrant culture that is always open to new ideas and believes in the ability of its people to help move the business.\nFlexibility and openness to change are among the strongest qualities of Nexus as a company. These are reflected on the various aspects of its business- from the management and the people, to the choice of solutions and quality of customer support.\n \nNexus maintains a strong network of IT solutions providers culled carefully from a genuine passion to provide solutions that offer genuine business advantage. The company has never been afraid to actively push new products. A local pioneer in solutions-based reselling, Nexus carried Hewlett-Packard and Microsoft back when they were new players in the server market. It approaches the business today with the same bravado.\nVeering away from products that have been too commodified, Nexus constantly strives for the most effective mix of value and pricing in its broad range of offerings.\n \nBeyond the sale, the company makes sure to stay with its customers through to implementation, ensuring service and support that enable customers to get the most returns from their investments.\n \nNexus maintains its focus as a corporate IT reseller and systems integrator while diversifying its IT services and product offerings. To further boost its value as a company to its partners-clients, principals, and stakeholders-Nexus started venturing into IT companies with different core businesses.",
